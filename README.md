### Directory and File Descriptions

- **.nuxt/**: Automatically generated by Nuxt. Contains build files and runtime configurations. You usually don’t need to modify files here directly.
- **assets/**: Contains static assets such as images and stylesheets that are processed by Nuxt's asset handling.
- **components/**: Holds Vue components used throughout the application. These can be shared across pages and layouts.
- **composables/**: Contains reusable composable functions that can be used in components and pages.
- **layouts/**: Defines application layouts that can wrap pages, like a main layout or an admin layout.
- **middleware/**: Contains middleware functions that can be used to manage route handling and user access control.
- **pages/**: Holds Vue files for each page route. The structure here defines the routing of the application.
- **plugins/**: Used for adding external libraries or custom plugins that extend the application.
- **public/**: Contains static files (e.g., images, fonts) that aren’t processed by Webpack. These files are served directly.
- **server/**: Holds server-only files like API routes and server-side middleware. This is where you’d add backend functionality.
- **utils/**: Stores utility functions that provide reusable logic or helper methods. Functions here can be imported and used across various components and modules, improving code organization and reducing redundancy.
- **app.vue**: The root component file for your application. It’s used as the main wrapper for all pages.
- **nuxt.config.ts**: The configuration file for Nuxt, where you can define modules, plugins, and build settings.
- **package.json**: Lists dependencies, scripts, and other project metadata.
